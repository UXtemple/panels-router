# Change log

## [0.5.0] - 2015-06-13
### Changed

- Updated example in Playground to inject stores and actions into the dumb component.
- Renamed `keys` to `panels` and its objects from: `{currentUri, panelUri}` to `{context, uri}` to
  resemble better what they do.
- Removed actions class. Export raw functions.
- Extracted store functionality into raw functions too getting them ready to be stripped off their
  state soon.
- Replaced `immutable-js` for `seamless-immutable` as it is lighter and its output are cleaner and
  backwards compatible with vanilla JS types.
- Removed the immutable record.

## [0.4.0] - 2015-06-07
### Added

- Teleports support through a better use of `currentUri` on each key - it now remembers the current app and refers to it as it should.

# [0.3.0] - 2015-05-30
### Added

- `Store#nextUri(from)`. With `from` being a `currentUri` we can now tell whether an action is
  active or not based on the next panel's URI.

### Changed

- Made store keys hold an object rather than a single string. It has two keys now, `currentUri`
  which tells the 'live' URI up until this panel and `panelUri` which is, as before, the URI of the
  panel we should be loading on that position.

## [0.2.3] - 2015-05-24
### Added

- An `onChange` callback to history so that a registering app can tell when the history changed to
  do stuff like updating the app's title.
- `Store#lastPanelUri`.

### Changed

- Fixed history to actually pick up the store changes.

## [0.2.1] - 2015-05-20
### Changed

- Fixed text and got dependencies right.

## [0.2.0] - 2015-05-20
### Changed

## [0.1.1] - 2015-04-01
### Changed

- Updated dependencies.

## [0.1.0] - 2015-03-18
### Added
- `ActionCreators`, `Constants`, `history`, `Parser` and `Router`.
  Flux constructs implemented through `Marty`.
